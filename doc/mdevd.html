<h1> The <tt>mdevd</tt> program </h1>

<p>
<tt>mdevd</tt> is a uevent manager. It connects to the netlink and reads
a series of uevents; for every uevent it reads, it performs
actions according to its configuration file. Actions can
be inserting a kernel module, creating or modifying device
entries in <tt>/dev</tt>, etc.
</p>

<p>
 <tt>mdevd</tt>'s configuration file uses the exact same
format as
<a href="https://git.busybox.net/busybox/plain/docs/mdev.txt">mdev</a>.
The differences between mdevd and mdev are:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> mdev needs to be registered as a hotplug manager and the
kernel spawns an instance of mdev per uevent; for every uevent,
mdev has to parse its configuration file. By contrast, mdevd is
a daemon: it's long-lived, and there is only one instance,
reading a series of uevents and
performing actions without forking; the configuration file is
read and parsed only once. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     mdevd [ -v <em>verbosity</em> ] [ -D <em>notif</em> ] [ -b <em>kbufsz</em> ] [ -f <em>conffile</em> ] [ -n ] [ -s <em>slashsys</em> ] [ -d <em>slashdev</em> ] [ -F <em>fwbase</em> ]
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> mdevd reads and parses its configuration file <tt>/etc/mdev.conf</tt>. </li>
 <li> It then connects to the netlink and reads from it, waiting for uevents.
 <li> It exits 0 on a SIGTERM. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Exit codes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> 0: SIGTERM received, clean exit </li>
 <li> 1: received an invalid event </li>
 <li> 2: syntax error in the configuration file </li>
 <li> 100: wrong usage </li>
 <li> 111: system call failed </li>
</ul>

<h2> Signals </h2>

<p>
 mdevd reacts to the following signals:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> SIGHUP: re-read the configuration file </li>
 <li> SIGTERM: exit as soon as possible </li>
</ul>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-v</tt>&nbsp;<em>verbosity</em>&nbsp;: be more or less verbose.
Default verbosity is 1. 0 will only print fatal error messages, 3 or more
is seriously verbose debugging. </li>
 <li> <tt>-D</tt>&nbsp;<em>notif</em>&nbsp;: when ready
(actually listening to the netlink),
write a newline to file descriptor <em>notif</em> then close it.
This allows mdevd to use the
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/notifywhenup.html">s6 mechanism to notify
readiness</a>. <em>notif</em> cannot be lesser than 3.
If this option is not given, no readiness notification is sent. </li>
 <li> <tt>-b</tt>&nbsp;<em>kbufsz</em>&nbsp;: try and reserve a kernel buffer of
<em>kbufsz</em> bytes for the netlink queue. Too large a buffer wastes kernel memory;
too small a buffer risks losing events. The default is 196608
(192 kB, which is on the large side for average systems). </li>
 <li> <tt>-n</tt>&nbsp;: dry run. mdevd will not create or delete
device nodes, and it will not spawn commands. Instead, it will print to stdout
the actions it would have performed. </li>
 <li> <tt>-f</tt>&nbsp;<em>conffile</em>&nbsp;: read the configuration
file from <em>conffile</em>. Default is <tt>/etc/mdev.conf</tt>.
<em>conffile</em> must be an absolute path. </li>
 <li> <tt>-s</tt>&nbsp;<em>slashsys</em>&nbsp;: assume the sysfs
pseudo-filesystem is mounted on <em>slashsys</em>. Default is <tt>/sys</tt>.
<em>slashsys</em> must be an absolute path. </li>
 <li> <tt>-d</tt>&nbsp;<em>slashdev</em>&nbsp;: assume the device nodes
are to be found in  <em>slashdev</em>. Default is <tt>/dev</tt>.
<em>slashdev</em> must be an absolute path. </li>
 <li> <tt>-F</tt>&nbsp;<em>fwbase</em>&nbsp;: assume the firmware files, if any,
are to be found in  <em>fwbase</em>. Default is <tt>/lib/firmware</tt>.
<em>fwbase</em> must be an absolute path. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Configuration file </h2>

<p>
 mdevd uses mdev's configuration file format.
A good <tt>mdev.conf</tt> example is available
<a href="https://github.com/slashbeast/mdev-like-a-boss/blob/master/mdev.conf">here.</a>
</p>

<p>
 If mdevd cannot find its configuration file, it will use a simple, basic default
configuration where it can create device nodes as root or delete them, and does
nothing else.
</p>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> The <tt>examples/</tt> subdirectory of the mdevd package contains
examples on how to run mdevd under various init systems / supervisors. These
examples do not show how to run mdevd as a logged service, because mdevd
should normally be run early in the system's boot up sequence, before
mounting the disks - so the presence of a mounted partition suitable for
logging is not guaranteed. In normal use, mdevd is quite terse, so it
runs smoothly without a dedicated logger, with its error messages
going to the catch-all logger. </li>
</ul>
